        <p>
            The United States Department of State has mandated that families hosting foreign exchange students
            undergo a background check. All family members in the home who are 18 years of age or older must
            be checked. We ask for your cooperation by completing this form and returning it to <b>Ayusa</b>
            headquarters by mail, fax, or to your Ayusa representative.
        </p>
        <p>
            My signature below authorizes <b>Ayusa</b> to conduct a background check with the personal information I
            have provided. This background check may include, but is not limited to, my driving history; a social
            security number verification; present and former addresses; child abuse registry; and police records. I understand that this
            authorization and release shall be valid for subsequent checks during my period of hosting with <b>Ayusa</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a host family member with <b>Ayusa</b>, I hereby attest to the truthfulness of the representations I have
            made. If any statement I have made is found to be false, my host family status with Ayusa may be
            revoked, regardless of the time elapsed before discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hereby release and agree to hold harmless from liability any person or organization that provides this
            information. I also agree to hold harmless <b>Ayusa</b>, and its officers, employees, and volunteers.
