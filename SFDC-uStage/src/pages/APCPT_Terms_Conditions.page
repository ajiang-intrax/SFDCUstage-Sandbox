<ol id="Fsection" class="reordered">
<li><b>Au Pair will receive room and board</b> in the form of meals and a suitable private bedroom in Host Family's home, which has been
  approved by a local AuPairCare representative. </li>
<li><b>Au Pair will receive a weekly stipend</b> in accordance with the U.S. Department of State Regulations in the amount of $195.75. Said

  Family, and cannot be withheld for any reason. </li>

  mutually agreed upon times. A 6-month extension Au Pair will receive one calendar week (5-days) of paid vacation. Vacation days shall

  AuPairCare for any reason, no refund, credit, or travel voucher will be provided. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that in 1994, the U.S. Department of Labor determined that the au pair stipend constitutes "wages" because an
  employer-employee relationship exists between the au pair and the Host Family. Au Pair's wages are essentially in the nature of
  household employment, and therefore Au Pair is required to file U.S. individual tax returns, even if no taxes are due. </li>
<li>Au Pair is responsible for complying with any Federal or state labor and/or income tax laws that may apply to Au Pair. AuPairCare
  does not provide legal advice regarding any such laws and is not responsible for informing Au Pair of, or overseeing compliance with, any

  state, and are subject to change from time to time. </li>

  recovering any such expenses or costs from AuPairCare.

  therein prior to arrival in the United States. Said information can be accessed on AuPairCare's website:
  http://www.aupaircare.com/current-au-pair/insurance. Au Pair is advised and agrees that any disputes pertaining to coverage issues
  are strictly between Au Pair and the third-party insurance company, and agrees that AuPairCare is not responsible for any coverage
  issues and/or disputes. Note: This section [43] does not apply to au pairs recruited by Originated Exchange Organization; STS Student
  Travel Schools AB. STS Travel School AB au pairs should refer to section [44]. </li>

  agrees to review the scope of said coverage and the limitations and exclusions contained therein prior to arrival in the United States.
  Said information can be accessed by visiting www.falck.com/travelcare. Au Pair is advised and agrees that any disputes pertaining to
  coverage issues are strictly between Au Pair and the third-party insurance company, and agrees that AuPairCare is not responsible for
  any coverage issues and/or disputes. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that pre-existing medical conditions will not be covered by the third-party travel and accident insurance. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that the dental insurance provided to them only covers injuries that are the result of an accident, and does

  that no unexpected complications arise during the period of residence abroad. </li>
<li>Au Pair represents that the medical history provided to AuPairCare is true, and gives full consent to release all medical and psychiatric
  history information to potential host families. </li>

  the U.S., Au Pair understands that s/he is required to notify AuPairCare and resubmit another Physician Verified Medical History
  document prior to arrival. As with all other terms of this Agreement, if Au Pair violates this term of the Agreement, AuPairCare may in
  its sole discretion terminate Au Pair's participation in the program and immediately repatriate Au Pair to his/her home country at Au
  Pair's expense. </li>
<li>Au Pair agrees that AuPairCare and/or its affiliates or agents may, without liability or expense to themselves, take whatever action they
  deem appropriate with regard to Au Pair's health and safety, including, but not limited to having Au Pair hospitalized for medical
  services and treatment. Au Pair further agrees that if hospitalization is not feasible for any reason, AuPairCare and/or its affiliates or
  agents may rely upon the advice and medical judgment of local medical staff in order to make a decision as to what is in Au Pair's best
  interests. Au Pair hereby gives full consent to be medically treated pursuant to the terms of set forth herein, and/or to undergo any
  treatment, including but not limited to surgery, which is determined to be necessary to Au Pair's health and well-being during Au Pair's
  stay abroad. </li>

  an extension fee to receive any coverage after the 365 days. </li>
<li>Au Pair accepts full responsibility for any medical expenses which are not covered by the insurance policy provided by AuPairCare
  through a third party. </li>
<li>In the event Au Pair displays a serious medical condition that in the judgment of AuPairCare prevents the Au Pair from continuing in the
  program (including but not limited to mental illness, substance abuse, eating disorders and/or pregnancy), whether said condition is
  pre-existing or new, Au Pair will be terminated from the au pair program at AuPairCare's sole discretion.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>H. Training and Education Requirements</h2>
<ol id="Hsection" class="reordered">
<li>Au Pair agrees to complete 32 hours of training prior to arrival at Host Family home, as required by the United States Department of
  State. To meet this requirement, Au Pair will attend in full the Au Pair Academy training program upon arrival in the United States
  and complete a required Pre-Departure Project as defined by AuPairCare. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that all 12-month program Au Pairs are required to attend courses of study at an accredited U.S. postsecondary
  institution for a minimum of six (6) credit hours or its equivalent in credit hours. Host Family will provide Au Pair with time
  off and provide adequate transportation to and from the place of instruction, and will pay tuition up to a maximum of $500 per au pair
  per year. Local AuPairCare Area Directors are available to provide information about this requirement and acceptable schools;
  however, it is Au Pair's responsibility to plan appropriately so that s/he is able to fulfill the requirement. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that all courses shall be taken at mutually agreed upon times with the Host Family. Au Pair shall be responsible
  for costs associated with such educational study that exceed the amount paid by Host Family. Au Pair agrees to submit an Education
  Plan at the start of the program year to outline coursework plans. Au Pair agrees to provide documentation of coursework completion
  towards the end of the program year. In the event Au Pair does not complete the educational requirement, Au Pair will be ineligible to
  apply for an extension of the au pair program.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>I. Extension of Au Pair Program</h2>
<ol id="Isection" class="reordered">
<li>Au Pair is hereby advised and understands that au pairs wishing to participate on the Extension Program must submit their application
  on or before AuPairCare's published deadline date and AuPairCare does not guarantee that AuPairCare or the Department of State will
  approve any extension request or that au pairs who choose to self-extend will match with a new Host Family. </li>
<li>Au Pair is hereby advised and understands that au pairs participating on the extension program will receive an updated DS-2019 form
  that reflects the 6, 9, or 12-month program extension. Although au pairs will have a valid DS-2019 form, the J-1 visa in his/her passport
  may have expired during the first 12-months of stay in the U.S. Any travel outside the U.S. is at the au pair's own risk, and AuPairCare
  cannot assist Au Pair or Host Family in resolving any visa concerns they may encounter. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that Extension Au Pairs are required to repeat the educational component of the program during the extension
  time as follows: The educational component for a 6-month extension is not less than three (3) semester hours of academic credit or its
  equivalent. Host Family will contribute up to $250 toward the educational component. The educational component for a 9 and 12-
  month extension is not less than six (6) semester hours of academic credit or its equivalent. Host Family will contribute up to $500
  toward the educational component. </li>
<li>Au Pair is hereby advised that by extending their program they must complete the new program terms in order to be eligible for a return
  flight home arranged by AuPairCare. In the event that the au pair chooses to leave the program early, he/she will be responsible for
  booking and paying for their own return flight home.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>J. Problem Resolution and Placement Changes</h2>
<ol id="Jsection" class="reordered">
<li>Au Pair is living as a member of a Host Family and is not under continual oversight or control of AuPairCare staff. Therefore, it is Au
  Pair's responsibility to promptly advise AuPairCare of any significant problems or events that occur during the program, including but
  not limited to Au Pair's health, safety, welfare, or adjustment to family, culture, or languages. For purposes of this Agreement, a
  "significant event or problem" is any change in Au Pair's circumstance that may affect an au pair's well-being and/or living situation. </li>
<li>Au Pair is hereby advised and understands that AuPairCare requires an initial adjustment period of 60 days following Au Pair's arrival
  before any placement change is considered; however, any decision regarding Au Pair removal is at AuPairCare's sole discretion and
  can be made at any time. </li>
<li>Au Pair should notify the local AuPairCare representative of any misunderstandings or problems with the Host Family if they persist after
  Au Pair has tried to address them with Host Family. AuPairCare will work with both Au Pair and Host Family to attempt to resolve the
  problem before authorizing a placement change. Au Pair must show a sustained good faith effort to resolve the issues with Host
  Family before AuPairCare will approve an Au Pair's request for a placement change. If Au Pair does not make a good faith and
  substantial effort to resolve the problems or misunderstandings with Host Family, or if Au Pair violates any terms of this Agreement,
  AuPairCare may in its sole discretion terminate the Au Pair's participation in the program and immediately repatriate Au Pair to his/her
  home country at Au Pair's expense. </li>
<li>Au Pair understands that the nature of the au pair program is one of flexibility and cultural exchange, and that placement changes may
  not be requested in order to achieve a preferred work schedule, location, or perks provided by Host Family. Once Au Pair agrees to
  match with a Host Family, Au Pair has in effect agreed to that Host Family's required schedule, location and benefits provided by the
  Host Family to Au Pair. Au Pair agrees to remain flexible in order to continually meet Host Family needs as they evolve over the course
  of the program year. Changes in Host Family needs do not constitute grounds for Au Pair to request a placement change. </li>
<li>In the event Au Pair's first placement is not successful, and AuPairCare determines in its sole judgment that Au Pair shall be placed in a
  new family, Au Pair agrees to cooperate with AuPairCare during the entire re-matching process, including but not limited to ensuring
  that potential new Host Families can easily reach Au Pair by e-mail and phone in a timely manner to arrange interviews. Au Pair is
  hereby advised and agrees that a replacement Host Family will be provided at the sole discretion of AuPairCare and may be dependent
  upon current Host Family availability. A replacement Host Family may not be available. In the event that AuPairCare is unable to
  provide a replacement Host Family within 14 days from the end of the first placement, Au Pair's participation in the program will end
  and Au Pair will have to return home at his/her personal expense. </li>
<li>If the Host Family is willing to house Au Pair until she or he is re-matched, and AuPairCare, in its sole discretion, determines that under
  the circumstances it would be reasonable for Au Pair to remain in the home, but the Au Pair refuses to stay with the family, Au Pair will
  be required to pay a $35.00 per day housing stipend to the party who houses him/her, typically an AuPairCare field staff member. </li>
<li>If Au Pair leaves the host family home without notice to AuPairCare and/ or Host Family and does not contact AuPairCare within 24
  hours from departure, Au Pair may be subject to dismissal from the program, and Au Pair may be immediately repatriated to his/her
  home country at Au Pair's expense. </li>
<li>In the event Au Pair does not successfully complete their first year program, and extension program, if applicable, Au Pair is responsible
  for his/her return travel expenses. </li>
<li>AuPairCare is not responsible for any economic damage or loss alleged to arise from loss of or unavailability of a replacement Host
  Family. </li>
<li>Au Pair agrees that any decision regarding an au pair's program status, dismissal, or re-placement will be made at the sole discretion of
  AuPairCare, and said decisions shall be considered final. </li>
<li>In the event of accident or serious illness or medical condition that, in the judgment of AuPairCare, prevents Au Pair from continuing
  her/his duties, she/he will end the program early and return home.</li>
 </ol>
 <h2>K. Other Terms and Conditions</h2>
 <ol id="Ksection" class="reordered"> 
<li>Au Pair agrees to leave the United States within 30 days of the conclusion of his/her program. Au Pair understands that any stay beyond

  work or live in the United States may be compromised. </li>
