        <h2>Intrax J-1 Visa Intern and Trainee Program Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p> Intrax, as a US Department of State designated Exchange Visitor Program, abides by all US Department of State regulations outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations governing the Exchange Visitor program <a href='http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a936b3810ca08f555020d22cc6afa48d&node=se22.1.62_122&rgn=div8' target='_blank'>(22 CFR Part 62)</a> and is the legal sponsor of each Trainee/Intern during their program. </p>
        <ul class="lower-latin">
          <li>Intrax is my legal sponsor while I am in the United States on the J-1 program.  I understand that I am not permitted to leave my Intrax sponsored training/internship program nor may I seek additional training/internship opportunities. Change of Host Company may be granted by Intrax at Intrax�s sole discretion and only with advanced written approval.</li>
          <li>I certify, within my knowledge, that I meet following program requirements to apply for the J-1 intern/trainee program.
          	<ul>
          		<li>J-1 Intern: be currently enrolled full-time and actively pursuing degree or certificate in a ministerially-recognized degree or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institution outside of the U.S. for at least 2 semesters OR be a recent graduate (within 12 months of program start date) from said institution. </li>
          		<li>J-1 Trainee: be a graduate of ministerially-recognized degree or certificate-granting post-secondary academic institution* outside of the United States with at least 1 year of work experience outside of the U.S. OR have five years’ work experience outside of the U.S.<br /><br />
          		*The academic institution is defined as any publicly or privately operated post-secondary intuition that offers primarily academic programs. An institution that offers primarily vocational or technical programs is not an academic institution. Participants’ education and work experience must match the internship and training field.</li>
          	</ul>
          </li>
          <li>The intent of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa Program is cultural exchange which also allows me to enhance my skills and improve my knowledge of American business methods that will be useful to me when I return home.   I will not seek any changes in visa status during my J-1 visa program sponsored by Intrax. I will leave the United States upon completion of my program.</li>
          <li>I agree to provide Intrax with my arrival date as well as an established U.S. address, phone number, and valid email address within seven (7) days of my arrival. During my stay in the U.S., I will notify Intrax of any changes in my address within seven (7) days of the change. <b>U.S. Government regulations stipulate that failure to do so will result in the automatic cancellation of my J1 visa.</b></li>
          <li>I understand that my SEVIS record will be canceled automatically if I do not check-in or update program dates with Intrax within 30 days of my program start dates.  Failure to inform Intrax of arrival or the program dates change may lead to program dismissal for early departure or reinstatement process for additional fee.  I understand I will not be able to apply for Social Security Number until my SEVIS record is reactivated.</li>
          <li>I understand that the maximum duration for an internship program is twelve (12) months and for training is eighteen (18) months (excluding Hospitality and Tourism trainings, which are limited to twelve (12) months). I realize that I will a have thirty (30) day grace period beyond the date printed on my DS 2019 form to travel within the U.S. and close any outstanding affairs. I understand that I am not allowed to continue my training at the hosting organization during the grace period. After the thirty (30) day grace period, I will leave the U.S. I understand that overstaying my visa or violating the terms of my visa can result in notification to the Department of State and the USCIS, federal fines, and disbarment from re-entry to the US for a period of up to ten (10) years.</li>
          <li>While in the United States, I must obey all federal, state, and local laws.  Failure to do so will result in my immediate dismissal from the Intrax program.  Intrax is not responsible for any civil or criminal liability I may incur or for defending me in any way in connection with any legal claims made against me.</li>
          <li>If I am dismissed from the Intrax Program for any reason, I will be out of status with my J-1 visa and will no longer have medical insurance provided by Intrax.
