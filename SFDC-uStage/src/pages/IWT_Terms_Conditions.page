                     <li>A DS-2019 form enables you to apply for a J-1 Work Travel visa. The U.S. Consulate may approve or deny your application for a visa. In rare cases, even if you receive a J-1 Work Travel visa, you may be denied entrance by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. IWT is not responsible for and cannot control or change these decisions.</li>
                     <li>Home-country physical presence requirement: If applicable, the U.S. Consulate will indicate if the two-year homestay rule applies on the visa. If it applies, then the participant &quot;must reside and be physically present in the country of nationality or last legal permanent residence for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States before the exchange visitor is eligible to apply for an immigrant visa or permanent residence&quot;, or for non-immigrant visas in the L or H categories as detailed at &sect; 62.2 Definitions.</li>

                 <ul>
                     <li>You are responsible for making your own travel and housing arrangements, and must provide your travel and housing plans at least two (2) weeks prior to arrival in the U.S. by ensuring that your plans are submitted to through your online IWT account. Failure to report travel information in a timely manner suggests that a visa has not been issued and may result in the loss of your job placement.</li>
                     <li>You must secure at least temporary housing prior to arrival.</li>

                 </ul>
              This is the only way for your program to be activated in the Student &amp; Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). Failure to do one of the above will result in your dismissal from the IWT Program and will lead to being out of J-1 visa status.
