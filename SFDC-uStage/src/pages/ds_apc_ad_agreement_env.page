        <h1>AuPairCare 2016 Area Director Letter of Agreement</h1>
        
        <p>AuPairCare Inc., a California corporation and Area Director, {!userProfile.User__r.FirstName} {!userProfile.User__r.LastName}, enter into the following 
        agreement for your employment as an AuPairCare Area Director.  You agree that you will perform your duties consistently with AuPairCare’s mission as described in the following paragraph, will support the program's goals, and adhere to the highest ethical and moral standards.</p>
        
        <h2 class="no-pgbr-af">PROGRAM MISSION</h2>
        <p>AuPairCare is committed to promoting international understanding and bringing together international au pairs and American families for a full 
        year of cultural exchange.  AuPairCare aims to deliver the highest quality of personal service to its host families and au pairs and to facilitate 
        communication between all parties.  AuPairCare further aims to closely supervise its program participants to carefully monitor compliance with the 
        program guidelines and U.S. Department of State Regulations.</p>
        
        <h2 class="">RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AREA DIRECTOR</h2>
        <p>As an Area Director you are responsible to market, organize and oversee the AuPairCare program in your assigned region including but not limited to the following duties:</p>
        <h3 class="">Customer Service</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>To familiarize yourself with important AuPairCare policies so that you can serve as an informed resource to your host families and au pairs.</li>
        <li>To contact and document all inquiries/leads received within 24 business hours and follow-up accordingly.</li>
        <li>To provide support to host families and Match Experts in the matching process.</li>
        <li>To inform families of financial obligations outlined in the Host Family Agreement prior to matching and inform families of refund and credit policy.</li>
        <li>To inform host families of travel arrangements for their au pairs and ensure that arrangements are made to greet each au pair at the airport or at Au Pair Academy.</li>
        <li>To provide mediation to families and au pairs as needed to facilitate the au pair/host family relationship.</li>
        <li>To provide an in-home exit interview with au pair/host family should the placement end prematurely.</li>
        <li>To organize and attend at least eleven social/cultural events during the program year for all au pairs in your region.</li>
        <li>To provide assistance, advice, and counseling as needed throughout the program to au pairs and host families, and to document such contact in AuPairCare’s database.  Establish a rapport with both the au pair and the host family so that both parties will develop a trust in the Area Director to serve as an impartial and sensitive mediator throughout the program year.</li>
        <li>To provide a monthly newsletter to au pairs and families in your region.</li>
        <li>To ensure that each au pair is informed of the educational, cultural, social and recreational opportunities within the community and to assist au pairs in completing the educational component of their program.  This includes working with au pairs on their educational plan and approving and verifying completion of their coursework.</li>
        <li>To provide interim room and board for an au pair in transition or in the event of an emergency, or to identify someone in your region who may be willing to provide
         housing should you be unable to do so. Area Directors understand that the au pair is entitled to suitable facilities for sleeping, but the au pair does not have to be
         in a private bedroom if one is not available. Area Directors also understand that the au pair should be provided healthful and adequate meals, but they may be of 
         modest cost, and that the au pair is required to clean-up after herself/himself. Area Directors agree that the daily stipend of $35.00 paid to field staff for an au pair 
         residing in the home is a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs of accommodating the au pair in-transition.  In the event there are circumstances that are unusual and make
         the $35.00 per day stipend inadequate, the Area Director will notify the Regional Manager of those circumstances and a further payment will be considered. Area Directors understand that she/he
         is not required to entertain the au pair during this time period and that any time the Area Director might spend with the au pair on business related time would be part of the effort to place the
         au pair with another family and would be compensated by the piecework amount paid to the Area Director for such placement.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="no-pgbr-af">Department of State Requirements</h3>
        <ol>

		<li>To contact at least two host family references via telephone or email to confirm the applicant family’s suitability for the program and to verify reference contact in AuPairCare’s database.</li>
		<li>To contact the host family and au pair via telephone, Skype or in person within 48 hours of the au pair’s arrival in the host community, and to document such contact in AuPairCare’s database.</li>
		<li>For in-country/transition au pairs, maintain contact by Skype, telephone or in-person with the au pair and the host separately, <strong>twice a month every two weeks</strong> for the first 60 days after the arrival.</li>
		<li>To conduct an in-home au pair/host family orientation within two weeks of each au pair’s arrival and to complete the orientation report in AuPairCare’s database.</li>
		<li>To organize and attend at least one host family day event per calendar year. </li>

Cultural activities do not count as part of the monthly contacts required.</strong></li>

        <li>To consult with your Regional Manager and receive prior approval for situations involving placement changes, refunds and host family/au pair dismissals or any other situation involving the health, safety and welfare of an au pair.</li>
        <li>To maintain the confidentiality of host family and au pair information regarding their participation in the program. To conduct all communication with host families, au pairs and AuPairCare employees in a professional manner.</li>
