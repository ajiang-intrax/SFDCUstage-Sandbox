           <h3>Custom Internship Groups</h3>
           <p>Custom Internship Groups combine the comfort of traveling as a group, independence of individualized internship placements, and benefits of 24/7 support from our team. 
           These programs are tailored to your university, college, or professional organization's needs. Participants spend the majority of their time engaged in a full-time internship position with a carefully screened host company or organization all while living, learning, and exploring their new city. Our staff members work closely with our university, college, and professional partners to assess the needs and goals for the group, then collaborate in screening applicants for the programs. 
           Each program operates uniquely, but all participants benefit from signature elements of the Intrax Global Internship.</p>

            <h3>Faculty Led Programs</h3>
            <p>Custom programs for student, academic, and professional groups who want immersive and experiential exposure in developing economies. 
            Leaders travel with participants into the field to apply training in practical and intercultural contexts. 
            Past examples have included service learning projects, pre-professional development experiences, practicums, and externships. Intrax staff members work closely with faculty-led group leaders in all elements of pre-program planning, from exploring options to final boarding call. 
            During this phase, leaders will also meet our Intrax on-site teams at their destination, who will meet them when they arrive and guide them through their Intrax experience. 
            Our on-site staff members are a mix of local staff members and expats with close ties to the local communities in Belize, Ghana, and Peru.</p>
