      <h1>AuPairCare Host Family Agreement</h1>
      <h2>General Provisions</h2>
      <p> This AuPairCare Host Family Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered
        into between AuPairCare, a California Corporation and <strong>{!Applicant_Info__c.Account__r.FirstName}
        {!Applicant_Info__c.Account__r.LastName}<apex:outputText rendered="{!spouseName != ''}" > and {!spouseName}</apex:outputText></strong> of <strong>{!Applicant_Info__c.Home_City__c}</strong>,
        <strong>{!Applicant_Info__c.Home_State__c}</strong>, acting
        on behalf of and including all members of said persons' household
        and family (hereinafter, in the aggregate, referred to as "Host").
        Host family has fully read this Agreement and agrees to the terms
        and conditions contained herein. <strong>This is an
        important, detailed and comprehensive Agreement, in light of the
        very serious nature of the relationship that develops between Host
        families and their respective au pairs, the very serious safety
        and other concerns that exist with respect to the well-being of au
        pairs placed with Host families, and the very serious concerns
        intrinsic in a live-in situation with the provision of care for
        young children. Accordingly, Host is hereby advised, instructed,
        and expected to fully read, acknowledge and agree to each and
        every provision contained herein. If Host has any concerns or
        questions whatsoever regarding any provision of this Agreement,
        those concerns and questions must be raised prior to Host's
        execution of the Agreement. AuPairCare will deem Host's execution
        of this Agreement to confirm Host's full understanding and consent
        to each and every term of this Agreement.</strong> </p>
      <p>The parties agree as follows:</p>
     <ol class="reordered" id="Asection">
        <li>Host will abide by the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement as long as the Host participates in the AuPairCare
          program, unless and until this Agreement is replaced or modified
          by a subsequent written agreement executed by AuPairCare and Host.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
     
         <h2>Department of State Requirements</h2>
         <ol class="reordered" id="Esection"> 
        <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that all au pairs
          are participants in a cultural exchange program, and agrees to
          comply with all of the regulations published by U.S. Department of
          State in 22 CFR Part 514, as the same may be amended from time to
          time in the future ("the Regulations"). Said regulations can be found by visiting
          http://j1visa.state.gov.</li>
        <li>Host affirms that they are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents and that 
		Host lives within one hour’s driving time of the home of the local AuPairCare representative. 
		In the event Host moves outside of the area covered by AuPairCare, Host will not be eligible to 
		continue in the program, and the au pair placement will be ended. In this case, 
		Host will be eligible to receive a refund in accordance with AuPairCare’s 
		refund policy set forth herein.
		</li>
        <li>Host agrees that the au pair will perform childcare services and light 
        housekeeping related to childcare that shall not exceed forty-five (45) hours per week, 
        five and one half (5 1/2) days per week, with a maximum of ten (10) hours per day. 
        Host agrees that the au pair will have one full weekend off per month (Friday evening 
        to Monday morning). If a dispute arises as to any of these limits or requirements, 
        AuPairCare shall resolve said dispute, and its decision shall be final.</li>
        <li>Host will restrict au pair’s responsibilities to childcare and related tasks. 
        This may include duties such as general supervision, preparing children’s meals, 
        straightening children’s rooms, doing children’s laundry and being present when 
        children are sleeping. Host agrees that the au pair’s responsibilities will not 
        include pet care, heavy housework, yard work, taking care of children of families 
        other than host family, providing care to incapacitated adults living in the host 
        home or related to the host family, or other labor related to the household. If a 
        dispute arises concerning the scope of the au pair’s responsibilities, AuPairCare 
        shall resolve said dispute, and its decision shall be final.</li>
        <li>Host is hereby advised and understands that in the event Host has an infant under the 
        age of two years old, the au pair must have 200 hours of documented experience working with 
        children under the age of two. Such documented experience shall be verified by AuPairCare prior 
        to au pair placement. Host agrees to promptly notify AuPairCare in the event a child under the 
        age of two joins the household at any time during the program. Host understands that any previously 
        placed au pair shall not be permitted to remain with Host if he/she does not have 200 hours of documented 
        experience working with children under the age of two.</li>
        <li>Host agrees that during the first three (3) days of an au pair’s 
        stay in the home, a parent or another responsible adult shall remain in 
        the home to facilitate the adjustment of the au pair into the family, household and community.</li>
        <li>Host agrees that in the event there is a baby less than three months old living in the home, a 
        parent or other responsible adult shall be present in the home <strong>at all times </strong>, and the au pair shall 
        not be the sole caregiver for that child <strong> at any time </strong>. </li>
        <li>Host shall promptly notify AuPairCare in writing in the event another individual, 
        including but not limited to other children, joins the household; there is a change 
        in marital status, location, contact information or other significant event that may 
        occur during the program. For purposes of this Agreement, a “significant event” is any 
        change in the household that may impact an au pair’s well-being and/or living situation.  
        If Host wishes to have a parent removed from the AuPairCare account, we must receive this 
        request in writing from both host parents. A host parent’s name cannot be removed unless both
         host parents are in agreement. In the event that a parent is removed from the account, please 
         note that account information will not be granted to the removed party. Only the host parent 
         remaining on the account and residing in the home with the au pair will be privy to confidential account information.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>J-1 Visa</h2>
         <ol class="reordered" id="Fsection"> 
        <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that the decision to 
        grant an au pair a J-1 visa is at the sole discretion of the U.S. 
        Embassy or Consulate in the au pair's country of residence. Host understands that 
        there is always a risk that an au pair will not be granted a J-1 visa to participate 
        in the AuPairCare program. Host further understands that AuPairCare does not provide any 
        compensation, including but not limited to compensation for alternative child care costs, in the 
        event of a visa denial, other than a program fee refund, excluding the initial application fee, 
        in the event Host chooses not to select another au pair.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Au Pair Selection and Placement</h2>
         <ol class="reordered" id="Gsection"> 
        <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that AuPairCare’s function is to locate and 
        present au pair candidates who meet AuPairCare selection criteria, but that final selection 
        of an au pair is the sole responsibility of Host. Host understands and agrees that while the 
        screening process does include a questionnaire pertaining to the au pair’s reported health, 
        AuPairCare cannot independently verify the accuracy of the representations made therein, and 
        is not responsible for any representations made by au pairs and/or their physicians with respect 
        to an au pair’s health or physical condition.<strong> Host understands and agrees that AuPairCare does not 
        guarantee that any particular au pair will be compatible in Host’s home, or meet Host’s expectations. </strong></li>
        <li>Host is hereby advised and agrees that AuPairCare does not guarantee childcare coverage at any time, including but 
        not limited to situations involving arrival delays, visa delays, au pair cancellations, visa denials, illness, 
        pregnancy, flight cancellations or delays, adverse weather conditions, and/or inability or unwillingness by an au 
        pair to fulfill her/his duties. Host hereby releases AuPairCare, its subsidiaries, officers, employees and/or agents 
        from any and all claims for financial, incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to costs of 
        alternative or interim childcare, loss of income, travel costs, emotional or psychological injury, or other loss or 
        damage of any kind which may arise from the unavailability of an au pair’s services for any reason whatsoever.</li>
        <li>Host is hereby advised, acknowledges and agrees that AuPairCare shall not be liable 
        for and does not guarantee acceptable performance by the au pair. Host agrees that the 
        au pair is not an employee, agent or independent contractor of AuPairCare, and that AuPairCare 
        does not exercise dominion or control over the actions of the au pair. AuPairCare is not responsible 
        for any act or omission on the part of the au pair.</li>
        </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Program Continuance</h2>
         <ol class="reordered" id="Hsection"> 
        <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that AuPairCare has the exclusive right to determine suitability of 
        Host to participate in the program. Host agrees that in determining suitability, AuPairCare may make inquiries to third 
        parties about Host and Host’s family members, and any other individuals residing at or frequently staying at Host’s residence. 
        Host represents that all information set forth in the Host Family Application is true and complete. </li>
        <li>Host agrees that AuPairCare may immediately terminate Host’s participation in the program and remove the au pair 
        from Host’s home, if a) AuPairCare determines, at its sole discretion, that the au pair is in an unsuitable environment, 
        or is being treated in an inappropriate manner by Host; or b) Host fails to comply with any terms of this Agreement, 
        including, but not limited to, failure to pay the full program fee or any other stipend or payment required hereunder; 
        or c) Host fails to comply with any of the Regulations; or d) AuPairCare determines, at its sole discretion, that the 
        Host is not cooperative with AuPairCare's staff or services. In the case of any such termination, Host shall not be 
        eligible for a program fee refund or credit.</li>
        
        </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Financial, Educational and Hosting Obligation</h2>
         <ol class="reordered" id="Isection"> 
        <li>Host agrees to provide au pair with room and board in the form of meals.  Host shall provide a suitable private bedroom 
        in Host’s home that meets all local and state building codes.</li>
        <li>Host agrees to pay a stipend to the au pair in accordance with the Department of State Regulations and those 
        of the AuPairCare program. The Department of State has set the current minimum weekly stipend amount at $195.75 as of July 23, 2009. 
        Said stipend shall be paid on the same mutually agreed upon day each week, and cannot be withheld for any reason, including but not 
        limited to outstanding bills of any nature, auto accidents or lost time due to illness. The au pair is entitled to start receiving the 
        stipend after one full week in the Host’s home. Stipend amount is subject to change during the program year if directed by the 
        Department of State.</li>
        
         <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that in 1994, the U.S. Department of Labor determined that the au pair 
         stipend constitutes "wages" because an employer-employee relationship exists between the au pair and the Host. 
         Au pair wages are essentially in the nature of household employment, and au pairs are required to file U.S. individual 
         tax returns. Host understands that Host is responsible for complying with any Federal or state labor and/or income tax 
         laws that may apply to Host. Host understands that AuPairCare is not responsible for providing, and will not provide, 
         any specific guidance in tax matters, but that said matters are strictly the responsibility of Host and the au pair.</li>
        
         <li>Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that due to the fact that an employee-employer relationship 
         exists between the Host and au pair, Host is responsible for determining whether Workers’ Compensation 
         insurance, or any other insurance requirements, is mandatory under federal, state and/or local laws. 
         Host is advised and understands that AuPairCare is not responsible for providing guidance as to such 
         insurance matters, but that the failure to comply with applicable laws in this regard can potentially 
         have severe consequences to Host. Host agrees to release and waive any claims it may have against 
         AuPairCare either directly, or indirectly, as the consequence of failing to provide insurance for an 
         au pair as set forth herein. Host further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless AuPairCare, its 
         subsidiaries, officers, employees and/or agents for any liability or expense, including court costs 
         and legal fees incurred, by AuPairCare, in the event of any dispute regarding coverage addressed 
         herein, whether Host acted directly or indirectly, and whether Host acted intentionally or unintentionally.</li>
         
          <li>Host agrees to provide the au pair with two weeks (10-days) paid vacation, to be taken at mutually 
          agreed upon times. Vacation days shall accrue on the basis of one day per month from the beginning of 
          the au pair’s third month in the U.S. During an au pair's extension program, Host will provide 9 and 
          12-month extending au pairs with two calendar weeks (10-days) of paid vacation, to be taken at mutually 
          agreed upon times. 6-month extension au pairs will receive one calendar week (5-days) of paid vacation. 
          Vacation days shall accrue on the basis of one day per month from the beginning of the au pair’s thirteenth 
          month in the U.S. If any disputes arise concerning vacation issues, AuPairCare shall resolve said dispute, 
          and its decision shall be final.</li>
         
          <li>Host will provide au pairs with adequate time to attend courses of study at an accredited U.S. 
          post-secondary institution (for a minimum of six (6) credit hours or its equivalent), to provide 
          adequate transportation to and from the place of instruction, and to pay tuition up to a maximum 
          of $500 per au pair per year. Extending au pairs are required to repeat the educational component 
          of the program during the extension time as follows: The educational component for 
          a 6-month extension is not less than three (3) semester hours of academic credit or its equivalent. 
          The host family contributes up to $250 toward the educational component. The educational component 
          for a 9 and 12-month extension is not less than six (6) semester hours of academic credit or its equivalent. 
          The host family contributes up to $500 toward the educational component.  Education amount is subject to 
          change during the program year if directed by the Department of State.</li>
          
           <li>Host will facilitate attendance and provide the au pair time off and transportation to AuPairCare’s 
           monthly gatherings. Host agrees to respond to the inquiries of AuPairCare staff, agents and employees; 
           and Host agrees to attend at least one Family Day event sponsored by AuPairCare per year.</li>
           
             <li>Host acknowledges and agrees that AuPairCare shall not be responsible for any personal bills incurred 
             by the au pair or Host, such as (without limitation) telephone bills, automobile expenses, travel expenses, 
             and/or health expenses. Accordingly, Host agrees not to seek payment or assistance in recovering any such 
             expenses or costs from AuPairCare.</li>
         
         
         
           <li>Host is hereby advised and understands that if they travel with the au pair outside of their 
           local community of placement and a problem arises, Host will be responsible for making 
           arrangements at their expense to promptly return the au pair to that community. 
           Host understands that travel with the au pair within the U.S. or outside of the U.S. should be limited to 30 days.  </li>
         
         
           <li>Host agrees to assist AuPairCare in ensuring that the au pair leaves the United States 
           at the conclusion of his/her program. </li>
         
       
         
        </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>Au Pair Medical Insurance</h2>
      <ol class="reordered" id="Jsection">
        <li>Host is hereby advised and understands that au pairs are provided with travel 
        and accident insurance by a third-party insurance company, and that such coverage 
        does contain limitations and exclusions. Host agrees to familiarize themselves with 
        the scope of said coverage and the limitations and exclusions contained therein. 
        Said information can be accessed on AuPairCare’s website, www.aupaircare.com. 
        Host is advised and agrees that any disputes pertaining to coverage issues are 
        strictly between the au pair and the third-party insurance company, and 
        Host agrees that AuPairCare will not assist in any disputes in coverage that may arise.</li>
              
        </ol>
       
         <p>&nbsp;</p>  
        <h2>Driving Responsibility</h2>
      <ol class="reordered" id="Ksection">
        <li>Host understands that there will be a transition period for the au pair to learn the 
        specific driving rules and regulations in Host state of residence and it is the 
        Host’s responsibility to help the au pair become acclimated to the vehicle, roads 
        and car safety rules.  Driving practice with the au pair is encouraged.</li>
        
         <li>Host is hereby advised and understands they are responsible for determining whether 
         the au pair will be able to legally drive in their state of residence. 
         As driving laws vary from state to state, it is the responsibility of the Host to 
         determine driving eligibility prior to the au pair’s arrival. If the au pair is to 
         drive while placed with Host, it is the Host’s responsibility to ensure that the au 
         pair has in fact met all requirements for driving legally in their state of residence.</li>
        
         <li>Host will provide automobile insurance with a minimum of $10,000 in medical coverage to 
         cover the au pair if she or he is expected or permitted to drive the family car(s). 
         Host is hereby advised and understands that the automobile insurance provided by the 
         Host is the primary insurance coverage when au pair or passengers need medical attention as a 
         result of a car accident and those benefits will be exhausted before the travel and accident 
         insurance provided by the program takes effect.  Host agrees that the au pair will not be 
         responsible for payment of any automobile insurance deductibles that exceed $250 per accident. 
         Host further agrees that Host will not hold AuPairCare liable for any damage or loss resulting 
         from the au pair’s use of a vehicle. Host acknowledges that it is the Host's responsibility to 
         conform to any and all state or local laws regarding the au pair's use of Host's automobile, 
         including obtaining a local driver's license, if required.</li>
              
        </ol>  
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Program Fees</h2>
      <ol class="reordered" id="Lsection">
        <li>AuPairCare program fees are provided on the Company website and are subject to change without notice.  
        Host is hereby advised and understands that program fees are used to cover au pair recruitment and 
        screening, the majority of international airfare, orientation and training, medical insurance costs, 
        placement and supervision of local field staff representatives. Host also understands that the au 
        pair may pay an insurance surcharge, airfare surcharge, application fees and/or other administrative 
        costs in his or her home country to participate in the program.</li>
        
         <li>An “in-country” au pair is an au pair who has 
         already been working in this capacity in the United 
         States at the time he or she may be placed with Host. 
         It can also include an extension au pair who is in-country and decides to extend his 
         or her program with another family. Host is hereby advised and acknowledges that if Host 
         elects to host an “in-country” au pair, regardless of program length or type, Host is 
         required to pay applicable in-country fees and comply with the outlined amounts of education 
         stipend and vacation time owed.</li>
        
         <li>Host agrees to abide by the payment terms outlined in the current AuPairCare program materials. 
         Host agrees to pay AuPairCare the full program fee plus any applicable domestic or international 
         surcharges or other fees established by AuPairCare related to providing Host with an au pair. 
         Host agrees to pay AuPairCare a <strong>$35 fee </strong>for any late payments, returned checks, credit card charge-backs, 
         or declined credit cards. Host understands that fees are subject to change without prior notification.</li>
              
              
               <li>Host agrees that it has adequate financial resources to satisfy all obligations as an AuPairCare Host Family.  
               In order to illustrate adequate financial resources, Host Family must meet all AuPairCare payment deadlines. 
               Host understands that late payments resulting in a delinquent account may result in the removal of the au pair from the home.</li>
              
        </ol>  
       
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       
          <h2>Placement Changes</h2>
      <ol class="reordered" id="Msection">
        <li>Placement change is defined as a match that ends prior to its original program end date.</li>
        
         <li>Host is hereby advised and understands that AuPairCare requires an <strong> initial adjustment period of   60 days </strong>
         following the au pair’s arrival before any placement change is considered; however, any decision regarding au 
         pair removal is at AuPairCare’s sole discretion.</li>
        
         <li>In the event of a placement change, the Host shall permit the 
         departing au pair to continue to live with Host for a period not 
         to exceed fourteen (14) days. During such interim period, the Host 
         in its discretion may request the departing au pair either to provide, 
         or to refrain from providing, any childcare services. If the au pair performs 
         any childcare services during the interim period, Host will pay the au pair his or her 
         regular stipend. Should AuPairCare determine that it is in the best interests of all 
         parties to remove the au pair prior to the end of the 14 day-period, Host agrees to 
         pay a<strong> $35/day </strong> housing stipend for the duration of the period.   Host understands and authorizes 
         that AuPairCare will charge the credit card on file for the housing stipend.</li>
              
              
               <li>In the event of accident or serious illness or medical condition (including pregnancy) that, 
               in the judgment of AuPairCare, prevents the au pair from continuing her/his duties, 
               she/he will end the program early and return home.</li>
               
                  <li>. Host agrees that any decision regarding an au pair’s program status, dismissal, or ability to rematch 
                  will be made at the sole discretion of AuPairCare, and said decisions shall be considered final.</li>

        receive an updated DS-2019 form that reflects the 6, 9, or 12-month program extension. 
        Although au pairs will have a valid DS-2019 form, the J-1 visa in his/her passport may 
        have expired during the first 12-months of stay in the U.S. AuPairCare discourages au 
        pair travel outside of the U.S. after the J-1 visa expires as au pairs may not be allowed 
        re-entry to the U.S. Any travel outside the U.S. is at the au pair’s own risk, and AuPairCare

        <li>Host understands and agrees that the use of any recording

          limited to the purpose of evaluating an au pair's performance with
          the child(ren) in the au pair's care, and shall not be used in any
          areas of Host's home in which an au pair has a reasonable
          expectation of privacy, including but not limited to bathrooms and
          bedrooms. Rather, the use of such devices shall be limited to
          common areas of the home, in which the au pair provides child
          care.</li>
        <li>Host understands that although AuPairCare will make its best, reasonable and diligent efforts at 
        locating, screening and training all au pairs, childcare, and in particular the care of infants under 
        the age of one year old, this is an inherently risky business. </li>
        <li>Host family agrees to assume the risks involved in the childcare provided by the au pair, 
        and hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, and fully waives, releases and forever discharges AuPairCare, 
        its subsidiaries, officers, employees, and/or agents from any and all claims related to personal and/or 
        property damage, injury, loss, delay or expense incurred by Host or any Host family member, guest, 
        employee or agent, due to: (i) events beyond AuPairCare’s reasonable control, including without 
        limitation acts of God, acts of war or governmental restrictions, and, in the absence of gross 
        negligence or willful misconduct by AuPairCare, (ii) any events and/or acts directly or indirectly 
        caused by any intentional or negligent acts or omissions at any time by any au pair and/or Host. 
        In this respect, Host acknowledges that the au pair is not an employee or agent of AuPairCare and 
        actions or omissions of the au pair are not to be attributed in any way to AuPairCare. Host fully 
        agrees to assume all such childcare risks and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless AuPairCare, 
        its subsidiaries, officers, employees and/or agents for any liability or expense, including court 
        costs and legal fees incurred, that Host has in any way caused or contributed to, whether directly

      on the petition of either party. Host agrees that California is a fair and reasonable venue for 
      resolution of any such dispute and it submits to jurisdiction of the Courts of the State of California 
      because, among other reasons, this agreement was negotiated in large part in California, and AuPairCare is domiciled in California.</p>
