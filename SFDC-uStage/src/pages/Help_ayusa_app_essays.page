		      <strong>Sample Student Letter to the Host Family</strong>
		    </p>
		    <p>Dear Host Family,</p>
		    <p>Thank you so much for being willing to participate in the exchange program and accepting me to live with your family.</p>
		    <p>I am a 15-year old Taiwanese girl and have just finished my junior high school. I like to try new things and I want to explore the world, including America. I want to learn about the American culture and share in your life.</p>
		    <p>I love Japanese comics. I am a very outgoing, straightforward, creative, artistic, academic and fun-loving person. I enjoy playing sports, such as badminton, tennis and swimming. I speak two different languages, Mandarin and Taiwanese, and I look forward to becoming fluent in English. Although I don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to volunteer in Taiwan, I want to participate in these activities in America. It makes me happy to help other people, especially older people and younger children.</p>
		    <p>I have played the flute for 7 years and it always brightens my days when I play it. I like to sing, and I hope to join the school choir in America. I understand that I may not be able to join the choir at my school so I am interested in trying other things and joining school clubs.</p>
		    <p>My dad is in charge of a company which produces machines and he is interested in bicycling. My mom is a full-time mother and she loves traveling. My younger sister is two years younger than me and she is in 7th grade. We are a close family and I hope to become a part of your family as well.</p>
		    <p>I think the Chinese characters and Chinese language are the most important parts of Chinese culture. I am glad to share the beauty of the Chinese culture with my host family. I also would like to show my host family how we celebrate the different Chinese festivals. For example, Moon Festival, Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival, Lantern Festival, etc. Also, I can share the knowledge of traditional toys and Taiwanese snacks, especially stinky tofu and pearl milk tea. I will sing some Taiwanese folk songs for you, too.</p>
		    <p>When I saw the wonderful pictures of my Ayusa sisters and brothers, it made me more determined to go to America and learn about your culture. I believe that I can also take amazing photos and have unforgettable memories with you and my new friends in America. I am excited to become a part of your family!</p>
		    <p>Warm Regards,</p>
		    <p>Signature (First name only)</p>
